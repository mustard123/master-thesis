\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would like to first thank Dr. Eryk Schiller for advising me in this project and Prof. Stiller, who is the head of Communication Systems Group, to welcome me in his lab and allow me to run this work under his supervision.
Eryk's office door was always open. He provided me with meaningful feedback, whenerver I ran into a trouble or had a question about my research or writing.
He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction when I needed it.
\\
Secondly, I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents and family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout the years of my study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. 
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
