\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Dr.Eryk Schiller and the Communication Systems Group Department under Prof. Dr. Stiller.
Eryk's door to his office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing.
He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right the direction whenever he thought I needed it.
\\
Secondly, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. 
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you
\\
