\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor [title] [Name Surname] of the [School / Faculty name] at [University name]. 
The door to Prof. [Last name] office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing.
He/She consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right the direction whenever he thought I needed it.
\\
Secondly, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my [partner, spouse, girl/boyfriend] for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. 
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you
\\
